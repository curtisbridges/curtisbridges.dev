## Day 1 = Done

I've completed [Day 1](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/1). Paul discusses Xcode, Playgrounds, and the basics of variables.

Coming from JavaScript, the differences in `var` and `let` are going to be troublesome; I actually prefer JavaScript's `let` and `const` (but NOT `var`!) right now. I'm sure I'll come around, eventually.

Swift's tooling looks to be much better than JavaScripts, if a lot less diverse.
