## My History with Swift

I've decided to make another run at learning Swift. I've attempted this before, several times:

1. I attended the inaugural BigNerdRanch [iOS and Swift Essentials](https://bignerdranch.com/bootcamps/2-ios-and-swift-essentials/)
2. Angela Yu's [iOS 11 App Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios11-app-development-bootcamp/)
3. Angela Yu's [iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/)
4. Stanford's [CS193p iPhone Application Development - Spring 2020](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpGHT1n4-mAtTj9oywMWoBx0dCGd51_yG)

All of these were excellent but ultimately didn't stick since I didn't continue using the skills I learned. I'm aiming to change that this time.™️

I'm now going to try [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/) [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui). Per Paul's instructions, I'm going to log my progress here.
